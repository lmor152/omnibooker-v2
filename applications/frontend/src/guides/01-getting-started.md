# Getting Started

Bookie Monster was born because I found it too difficult to regularly book tennis sessions living in London. Most courts offer full refunds if you cancel your bookings with enough notice, so automated booking is a perfect solution!

## Concepts 

- **Provider** - these are the different platforms sports facilities use to manage their bookings. Clubspark and Better are examples that are used a lot for tennis, but lots of places also build their own ones. You need to register your provider in Bookie Monster so that it knows your details to make bookings on your behalf.
- **Booking Session** - these are the recurring bookings you want to make - e.g. pilates every Monday or tennis every Friday. Let Bookie Monster know the settings for your preferred booking, and when the bookings become available so that it can make the booking as soon as possible.
- **Booking Task** - these are specific instances of your bookings, e.g. tennis on a specific date. These are attempts Bookie Monster will make / has made on your behalf. You can cancel upcoming ones if you don't want to make a booking that week, or see errors that might have happened for previous attempts.
