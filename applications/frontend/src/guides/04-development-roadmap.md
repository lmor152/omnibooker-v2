# Development Roadmap
These are some features I'm looking at building into Bookie Monster

- **Notifications** - email notifications for when bookings fail to complete.
- **More providers** - more platforms for booking, let me know if you have any ideas!
- **Availability checking** - automated checking for availability once booking has opened up. At the moment, Bookie Monster only makes one attempt at booking, this would allow it to regularly check if your desired slot has opened up.
